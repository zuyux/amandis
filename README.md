## üîí Privacy Features

### Nostr Protocol

Amandis uses the [Nostr(]https://nostr.com) (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) protocol, a simple, open protocol that enables global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media. This allows users to:

- Own their identity through cryptographic keys
- Control their data and decide what to share
- Connect with others without a central authority


### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zero-knowledge proofs allow users to prove statements about their data without revealing the data itself:

- Prove you're over 21 without revealing your exact age
- Verify you live within 10 miles without sharing your address
- Confirm shared interests without exposing your entire profile
